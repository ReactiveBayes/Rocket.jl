export skip_complete

import Base: show

"""
    skip_complete()

Creates a `skip_complete` operator, which filters out `complete` event by the source Observable by emitting only
`next` and `error` messages.

# Producing

Stream of type `<: Subscribable{L}` where `L` refers to type of source stream

# Examples
```jldoctest
using Rocket

source = from([ 1, 2, 3 ])
subscribe!(source |> skip_complete(), logger())
;

# output
[LogActor] Data: 1
[LogActor] Data: 2
[LogActor] Data: 3

```
